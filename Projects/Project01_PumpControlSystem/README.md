# üö∞ Project 1: Pump Control System with PID & Alarm Handling  
**Studio 5000 Emulator-Based PLC Project**

This project simulates an industrial pump system with both manual and PID-based automatic control modes, using scaled analog signals and structured ladder logic. Alarms are triggered based on tank level, with reset and latch logic built in.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Start/Stop pump control with fail-safe STOP logic
- PID auto mode for flow-based VFD speed control
- Analog scaling for flow, tank level, and speed
- Low/High level alarms with delay, latch, and reset
- Modular ladder logic with alias-based IO mapping
- Fully testable in Studio 5000 Emulator
