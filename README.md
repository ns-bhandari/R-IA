## 📘 About This Portfolio

This repository documents a growing collection of real-world industrial automation projects focused on building reliable, scalable, and safety-integrated systems.

Projects emphasize system thinking — from logic and alarm design to operator interface and robot motion — and follow engineering workflows aligned with modern manufacturing environments.

**Industrial Networking & Functional Safety**  
*Ethernet/IP, PROFINET, OPC UA, MQTT (intro level)*  
- Configuring PLC-device communication using industrial networking protocols  
- Designing E-stop logic, feedback validation, and fault-tolerant shutdown routines  
- Applying functional safety principles (SIL levels, FMEA concepts)

**Engineering Documentation & Workflow**  
*GitHub, Excel, Rockwell/Siemens utilities*  
- Creating I/O lists, tag tables, and functional requirement specs  
- Structuring project files, version control, and logic documentation  
- Maintaining traceable and readable automation code

## 📂 Projects

All portfolio projects will be organized in the [📁 `projects/`](./projects) directory.

Each project will include:
- A dedicated folder with logic files, screenshots, and documentation
- A `README.md` explaining the system, logic structure, and tools used
- Work that reflects system-level control, safety, diagnostics, and operator interaction

> ✅ Project 1 (Liquid Blending System) has been added. More to follow.

## 🎯 Career Focus

I’m pursuing engineering roles in:

- Industrial Automation & Control Systems  
- Robotics Programming & Integration  
- PLC/HMI/SCADA Development  
- Smart Manufacturing and IIoT Systems

This portfolio reflects end-to-end project ownership, not just code — combining engineering discipline, safety integration, and system-level thinking.
