# 👤 About Me

Hi, I’m **Neel Bhandari** — a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for **industrial automation**, **robotics**, and **advanced manufacturing**.

With hands-on experience in both **design engineering** and **automation technologies**, I bring a cross-functional approach to building smarter, safer, and more efficient systems. This portfolio documents my technical journey across **PLC programming**, **robotic simulation**, **SCADA/HMI development**, and **CNC-based production workflows** — all grounded in real tools used in the field.

### 🌐 Why This Portfolio

I created this platform to:
- Learn by building — not just reading
- Simulate real plant scenarios using pro-grade tools
- Demonstrate structured thinking and system-level design
- Document my progress for employers, peers, and collaborators

Each project is a step toward deeper expertise in robotics, control logic, and smart manufacturing — bridging mechanical design with industrial automation.
