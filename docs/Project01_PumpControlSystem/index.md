# ðŸš° Project 1: Pump Control System with PID & Alarm Handling

This project simulates a pump control system built in **Studio 5000**, tested using **Logix Emulate**, and designed to control tank level via **PID-driven flow**. The system includes manual/auto modes, analog signal scaling, alarm latching, and structured PLC logic.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- Dual-mode operation: Manual & Auto (PID)
- Alarm system with delay, one-shot, and reset
- Analog scaling (4â€“20 mA) for flow and tank level
- Modular ladder routines with clear tag structure
- Safety-aware logic with latched faults and interlocks
