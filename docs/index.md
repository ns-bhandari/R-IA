# 🤖 Robotics & Industrial Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my hands-on engineering portfolio, focused on building robust, scalable, and safety-conscious control systems using professional tools from the industrial automation and robotics ecosystem.

This project-based site reflects my accelerated learning plan in **PLC programming**, **HMI/SCADA design**, **robot programming**, and **industrial communication**, aligned with modern manufacturing practices.
