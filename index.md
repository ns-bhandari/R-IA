# 👨‍💻 Neel Bhandari's  Robotics & Industrial Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my [project](projects)-based portfolio showcasing real-world skills in **industrial automation, robotic integration, and control system design**. This site documents hands-on learning across **PLC programming**, **HMI/SCADA development**, **robot motion**, and **networked industrial systems** — using tools widely adopted in manufacturing environments like **Studio 5000**, **TIA Portal**, **FANUC RoboGuide**, and **KUKA.Sim**.

Each project is designed to reflect professional engineering workflows — structured logic, process safety, diagnostics, and operator usability — aligned with **IEC 61131-3 programming standards** and modern factory practices.

### 🧠 Core Technical Focus

- **PLC Programming (IEC 61131-3)** – Ladder Diagram (LD), Structured Text (ST), and Function Block Diagram (FBD) for process control, sequencing, and interlocks  
- **HMI & SCADA Development** – Dynamic screens, alarm handling, and real-time data visualization using FactoryTalk View and WinCC  
- **Robotic Programming & Simulation** – Offline programming for pick-and-place, motion planning, and TCP configuration using RoboGuide and KUKA.Sim  
- **Industrial Communication Protocols** – Ethernet/IP, PROFINET, OPC UA for structured communication between PLCs, HMIs, and smart devices  
- **Safety & Alarm Logic** – Emergency stops, latching faults, alarm resets, and system behavior aligned with functional safety principles  
- **Modular Engineering Practices** – Tag aliasing, re-usable subroutines, IO mapping, documentation, and simulation-based validation

### 🎯 Portfolio Purpose

This site is more than a showcase — it’s a live demonstration of applied engineering thinking. Each project emphasizes:

- 🧠 Modular, readable, and testable logic  
- 🔐 Safe start/stop behavior and fault management  
- ⚡ Clean communication between hardware and software layers  
- 🤖 Cross-platform system integration with robotics, HMI, and control logic
