# 📂 Projects

This section showcases my hands-on work in **industrial automation**, **robotic systems**, and **control logic engineering** — built using industry-grade tools like **Studio 5000**, **TIA Portal**, **FANUC RoboGuide**, and **KUKA.Sim**.

Each project is structured to reflect real-world engineering practices, with a focus on:

- 🧠 Modular PLC logic (IEC 61131-3 compliant)
- 🎛️ HMI-ready alarms, interlocks, and feedback scaling
- 🤖 Robot-cell coordination and simulation
- 🧪 Emulator-based testing for complete offline validation

### ✅ Featured Project

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [🚰 Project 1: Pump Control System with PID & Alarm Handling](projects/Project02_PumpControlSystem) | A complete control logic system simulating a tank-based flow process. Includes dual-mode control (Manual + PID Auto), alarm latching logic, analog signal scaling (4–20 mA), and modular Studio 5000 routines. Fully emulator-compatible. |

---

> More projects will be added covering robotic path planning, batching systems, interlocked conveyors, digital twin simulations, and SCADA integration.

For each project, you'll find:

- 📄 Logic documentation and tag structure  
- 📸 Screenshots from HMI, PLC, or robot environments  
- 📑 PDF summaries and test procedures  
- 🔗 Links to code and simulation assets (where applicable)

This portfolio evolves with each skill milestone — reflecting not just code, but full system thinking.
