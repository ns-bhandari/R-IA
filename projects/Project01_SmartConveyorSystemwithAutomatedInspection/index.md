# Smart Conveyor System with Automated Inspection & Reject Handling

> **Technologies:** Rockwell Studio 5000 Logix Designer Â· ControlLogix 5570 Emulator  
> **Key Concepts:** Modular PLC Programming Â· UDTs & AOIs Â· FIFO Part Tracking Â· Alarm Handling

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

A **multi-zone conveyor system** that detects, inspects, and automatically rejects defective parts â€” built and tested entirely in **Studio 5000** with the **ControlLogix 5570 Emulator** (no physical I/O required).  
The project models an industrial **inspection line** such as those used in packaging or assembly plants.

## ðŸŽ¯ Highlights

- **Auto / Manual Modes** â€” safe start/stop sequencing and full manual jog control.  
- **Reusable Motor Control** â€” `AOI_ConveyorMotor` for each conveyor zone.  
- **FIFO Queue Tracking** â€” keeps part order from entry to exit.  
- **Automated Inspection** â€” checks label, seal, and weight; rejects failures.  
- **Scalable Alarm Handling** â€” modular `AOI_Alarm` with trip, latch, and acknowledge.  
- **Structured Codebase** â€” routines split for IO mapping, modes, conveyor control, inspection, FIFO, and alarms.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Fully **simulated and validated** in the Studio 5000 Emulator.  
- Functional test matrix covers auto start/stop, inspection pass/fail, reject actuation, alarms, and manual jogging.  
- No physical chassis or wiring required â€” ideal for a learning environment and portfolio demonstration.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates **OEM/integrator-style PLC design** â€” modular, data-driven, and scalable â€” and shows ability to design, test, and document complete control systems without physical hardware.
