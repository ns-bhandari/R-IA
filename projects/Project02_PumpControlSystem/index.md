# üö∞ Project 2: Pump Control System with PID & Alarm Handling

This project simulates a real-world pump-tank automation system using **Rockwell Studio 5000** and **Logix Emulate**. It supports both **manual and PID-driven automatic modes**, with analog signal scaling, alarm latching, and modular ladder logic.

---

## üß† System Overview

- Manual & Auto mode with operator selection
- PID-based flow regulation with live analog scaling (4‚Äì20 mA)
- High/Low tank level alarm system with one-shot + latch logic
- Resettable alarms and mode indicators for HMI readiness
- Modular routines: `IO`, `CTRL`, `MODE_SELECTION`, `ALARMS_NOTIFICATION`
- Developed and tested using **emulator-compatible modules**

These screens visualize:
- Process variables (Tank Level %, Flow LPM, VFD Speed %)
- Real-time system state: Manual vs Auto
- Alarm activation and reset handling
- Mode and start/stop control logic
